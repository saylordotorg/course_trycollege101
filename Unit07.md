**Unit 7: Academic Writing and Research in College** <span
id="7"></span> 
*This unit addresses a very important topic: college-level writing.
Improved writing is one of the major, universal skills that you will
take away from a college experience, and it will likely be the skill you
use most in your post-college life. Consider for a minute the many ways
in which your writing is the first impression people have of you: for
example, when you compose emails, write thank-you notes to your parents’
friends, complete job applications, draft the report your supervisor
forwards to the CEO, or post to your blog or personal website. Good
writing will distinguish you dramatically from your peers and bring you
terrific advantages in the long term.  
    
 Yet, college writing is a very specific kind of writing, with its own
set of rules and requirements that are different from any writing you
will probably do before or after college. College writing is designed to
teach you about methodical thinking. Writing out a problem, organizing
the pieces of the solution to the problem, and then describing the
solution clearly for the reader requires you, the writer, to think
carefully about the problem itself. So, good writing is both a goal in
itself and a tool you will use to reach other goals.  
    
 Writing in college is often also designed to teach you about academic
research, provide you with opportunities to conduct research, and teach
you how to present the results of research. In some classes, you might
write about research you physically do – such as lab research in a
biology or psychology class – but in other classes researchmeans reading
what many other people think about a topic, then coming to your own
conclusion on it. This unit covers the basic process for doing this
second form of research, including the important issue of how to find
quality information and trusted resources on the Internet.  
    
 In sum, this unit of the course will help you understand the steps you
need to follow to become a better academic writer.*

    a Better
    Writer?”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/College%20Success.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: In Section 8.2 of the textbook, read the text below
    the headings titled “Plagiarism – and How To Avoid It” and “Forms of
    Citation.” Be sure that you understand the underlying reasons why it
    is important to cite where you have found information. Many students
    learn how to cite without understanding that citation is an
    important research tool and a critical component of academic
    integrity – not a meaningless rule. After you have completed this
    reading, work through the checkpoint exercises at the end of the
    section.  
        
     This resource also covers the topics outlined in subunits
    7.4.1-7.4.4 below.   
        
     Reading this section and completing the exercises should take
    approximately 1 hour to complete.

**7.4.1 Someone Else’s Words** <span id="7.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit 7.4
above. Pay special attention to the paragraph about the dangers of using
another writer’s words in your own writing. There is a correct way to do
this that is not plagiarism – this method will be covered in more detail
in subunit 7.4.4 below.*

**7.4.2 Someone Else’s Ideas** <span id="7.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit 7.4
above. Just like words, ideas also belong to the original writer. In
college, you will be encouraged to read and use other people’s words and
ideas, but you will need to know the correct and incorrect ways to do
so! Subunit 7.4.4, below, will show you the correct way.*

**7.4.3 Common Knowledge vs. Distinct Contributions** <span
id="7.4.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit 7.4
above. Many students struggle with knowing what is common knowledge and
what needs a citation. If you are ever in doubt about whether to cite
something or not, err on the side of caution and cite it. You will never
get in trouble for telling someone where you found your information –
but you might get in trouble if you do not.*

**7.4.4 Citing Your Sources** <span id="7.4.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is partially covered in subunit 7.4 above. The reading
under the heading titled “Forms of Citation” gives you the names of
different citation methods you may be asked to use, but it does not
actually describe the methods or show you how to use them. You have
already explored several great online resources and citation
manuals. For your convenience, links to two important citation styles,
MLA and APA, have been provided again below for your review. Click on
one or both of the links below to further explore these
resources. Specifically pay attention to the menu of clickable links
that run down the left-hand side of the page. These links include both
style guides as well as examples of specific citations and documents
that you can use as models. Do this right now, while you are thinking
about citations. Don’t wait until you need this information at the end
of a research assignment! Because different instructors may ask for
different types of citation formats, it might be a good idea to bookmark
both of these webpages for later use.*

**7.4.5 Style Points for Using Quotations** <span id="7.4.5"></span> 
*Note: Many new college writers struggle with how to integrate the
research they have collected from other sources into their own writing.
Learning the mechanics of how to do this is one thing (which you learned
earlier in this unit) but what about style? Read the “Quoting,
Paraphrasing, and Summarizing” resource found via the first link below
to understand your different choices. Then, click on the second link
below, which provides you with an essay and a sample summary,
paraphrase, and quotation from the essay. Before reviewing the sample
summary, paraphrase, and quotation, you may want practice writing your
own summary, paraphrase, and quotation based on the essay, and then
compare your work to the sample provided. Make sure you understand how
these elements are different from each other and how to create your own
summary, paraphrase, and quotation in the future.*

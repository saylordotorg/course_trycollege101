**Unit 3: Create an Effective Time Management Plan** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This unit will help you create a reasonable time-management plan that
emphasizes an appropriate amount of time for you to spend on
school-related work. One of the most interesting activities in this unit
will help you accurately identify how you spend the hours in your
week. If you work through the diagnostic questionnaires included in this
unit honestly, you may be surprised to learn how much time you spend
doing (or not doing) ordinary activities. Many peoples’ first estimates
about where their time goes are inaccurate, so do not be surprised if
you have to adjust your first guess.  
    
 One of the most difficult life lessons to learn is that, as adults, we
simply will not have enough time for everything we want to do. This unit
will help you come up with a realistic plan that prioritizes the things
that are most important to you based on the values and goals you have
already identified and schedule time to ensure that you can accomplish
them. Next, you will learn about strategies for sticking to your
schedule in the face of distractions, frustration, procrastination, and
non-academic personal commitments. Finally, you will see how two basic
tools – a calendar planner and a daily to-do list – can be powerful
assets in your time-management plan.*

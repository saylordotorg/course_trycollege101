**Unit 5: Learning Styles and Learning Processes** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the higher-level concepts of critical thinking and
creative thinking, which are major components of college-level learning.
Critical thinking is a level of thinking that requires more effort than
simple memorization of facts or solving problems that have a right and a
wrong answer. It requires you to make value judgments, either based on
personal opinions you have formed, or based on additional information
about a situation. In particular, a problem with more than one correct
answer, or no correct answer, requires critical thinking to solve. A
college-level education will include – and require – much more of this
type of thinking than you may be used to, but the effort will be well
worth it and very rewarding!  
    
 This unit also introduces you to the various styles of learning that
exist and helps you explore which style works best for you, how to use
your predominant learning style, and how to improve your ability to use
other learning styles. You may have heard about different learning
styles before, or perhaps this concept is completely new to you. Each
person processes information differently, and knowing how your own mind
works is a powerful piece of information that can improve your study
skills. Other people in your learning environment – teachers, students,
co-workers, and writers, for example – may not always provide new
information in the format that you like best. But once you have
identified your own learning needs, you can better translate new
information into a format that is easiest for you to understand and
remember.*

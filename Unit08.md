**Unit 8: Using and Improving Your Memory Skills** <span id="8"></span> 
*This short unit focuses exclusively on improving your memory skills.
Memorization is an interesting problem for the college student because,
unlike in high school, just knowing a list of facts is unlikely to be
the end goal of your learning. You will need to memorize information in
college, but primarily so that you have access to this information in
order to perform the higher-level thinking skills that will be discussed
in Unit 5 of this course.  
    
 Because memorization is a common study skill for high school subjects,
you may already have specific strategies that you employ. Nonetheless,
as with the other critical undergraduate skills of listening,
note-taking, reading, and writing, you can improve your memorization
skills by studying the advanced memorization techniques discussed in
this unit.*

these down in your notebook as examples. Reading this textbook section
and completing the notebook question should take approximately 15
minutes.*

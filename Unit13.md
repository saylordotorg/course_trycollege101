    order to tailor both your résumé and your cover letter to a
    company’s specific needs.  
        
     This material also covers the topics outlined in subunits 13.5.1
    through 13.5.5 below.

**13.5.1 The Purpose of a Résumé** <span id="13.5.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
13.5 above. Spend approximately 15 minutes reviewing the bullet points
that explain the generally accepted principles of résumé building.

*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
13.5 above. Spend approximately 15 minutes reviewing the section titled
“The Finishing Touches.” It is usually better to keep formatting as
simple as possible. In today’s electronic age, many résumés are read by
machines before they are read by human eyes – so fancy formatting could
compromise your résumé or even eliminate you from consideration before a
person ever reads your résumé!*

*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
13.5 above. Spend approximately 15 minutes reviewing the section titled

letter. Keep in mind that a cover letter should be adapted to the
specific job being applied for and geared toward the specific company
being applied to. This knowledge will help you avoid producing a general
cover letter that might go unnoticed.*

**Unit 6: Listen, Take Notes, Read, and Study** <span id="6"></span> 
*The five most basic building blocks of learning in college – and
elsewhere – are reading, writing, listening, taking notes, and
studying. You have already learned how to improve your reading skills in
Unit 4 and explored your learning style in Unit 5. This unit introduces
you to concepts that will also improve the learning skills you use
during class, including listening and taking notes during instruction
and discussion. You almost certainly already know how to practice these
skills to some extent, but this unit provides you with tools to practice
these skills more efficiently.  
    
 Like any other skill, the key to improving your effectiveness in
listening, taking notes, reading, and studying is to understand each
skill better. Just as a baseball player or golfer will not get better at
hitting the ball by continuing to swing poorly over and over, you will
not become a better listener by continuing to listen poorly! The athlete
needs to look at his swing, get advice on how to swing better, and
practice the better swing. Even professional athletes analyze their
performance in order to improve, so no matter how good you already are
at the skills covered in this unit, you can always work on these skills
in order to become a better student.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   describe the elements of effective listening;
-   demonstrate strategies that make listening more effective;
-   explain the elements of the *learning cycle*;
-   explain the roles of listening and taking notes in the learning
    cycle, and discuss why they are important;
-   compare and contrast the four primary methods of note-taking: lists,
    outlines, concept maps, and the Cornell Method;
-   identify note-taking methods that support your preferred learning
    style and/or an instructor's teaching style;

**6.1 The Learning Cycle: Prepare, Absorb, Capture/Record,
Review/Apply** <span id="6.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *College Success*: “Chapter 4: Section 4.1: Setting
    Yourself Up for Success”**
    Link: *College Success*: [“Chapter 4: Section 4.1: Setting Yourself
    Up for
    Success”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/College%20Success.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the Chapter 4 introductory text, as well as
    Section 4.1, to identify the roles of listening and note-taking in
    the learning cycle. Then, write a brief paragraph in your notebook
    summarizing how practicing these skills in high school differs from
    practicing these skills in college.  
      
     Reading this section and writing your response in your notebook
    should take you approximately 1 hour to complete.

**6.2 Prepare to Learn in Class** <span id="6.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *College Success*: “Chapter 4, Section 4.2: Are You Ready
    for Class?”**
    Link: *College Success*: [“Chapter 4, Section 4.2: Are You Ready for
    Class?”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/College%20Success.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this section. Consider writing your answers to
    the three main questions at the beginning of the reading in your
    notebook. Being prepared to learn could be the most important factor
    in determining what you get out of going to class. This reading is
    very short but presents key steps to follow before you enter the
    classroom.  If you are an online student (for example, in studies at
    Saylor.org), consider how these steps will still apply to you in
    your online learning environment.  
        
     Reading this section should take you approximately 15 minutes to
    complete.

**6.3 Absorb Information Using Active Listening** <span

    Really Listening?”**
    Link: *College Success*: [“Chapter 4, Section 4.3: Are You Really
    Listening?”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/College%20Success.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: In Section 4.3, read from the beginning of the
    section through the box titled “Principles of Active Listening.” Pay
    close attention to the description of this skill; it is not the same
    concept as just plain listening! Even if you are an online student,
    these skills will be of great benefit to you. Good active listening
    skills are critical for viewing online lectures, videos, and other
    course media. As an active learner, you are not a passive consumer
    of knowledge, but rather an alert participant.   
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 15 minutes to
    complete.

**6.4 Strategies to Improve Your Listening** <span id="6.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: *College Success*: “Chapter 4, Section 4.3: Are You
    Really Listening?”**
    Link: *College Success*: [“Chapter 4, Section 4.3: Are You Really
    Listening?”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/College%20Success.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Pick up the Section 4.3 reading where you left off in
    Subunit 6.3 (from “Activity: Listening to Your Whole Body” onward)
    to learn additional strategies for staying active while you
    listen. Even if you are an online student, these skills will pay off
    great rewards. When interacting with online course content,
    eliminate distractions, lean forward, focus on what is being said
    and make note of questions you may have as if you were in front of a
    live instructor. Even though you may not have ready access to a live
    instructor who can immediately answer questions, noting your
    questions will allow you to focus on the material. You may be able
    to answer most of these questions through conducting independent
    reading of related texts, reviewing the course materials (textbooks,
    assignments, and lectures) and performing independent online
    research. You may also wish to establish or join a study group or
    online discussion forum in order to share questions and answers with
    fellow learners.    
     After reading the rest of Section 4.3, make sure to complete the
    checkpoint exercises at the end of the reading.  
        
     Reading this section and completing the exercises should take
    approximately 1 hour to complete.

    should take notes in class, some effective note-taking methods, and
    what to do with your notes once you have taken them.  Make sure to
    complete the checkpoint exercises at the end of the reading.  
        
     Please note that this reading also provides the information you
    need to know for subunit 6.5.1 below.

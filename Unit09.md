**Unit 9: Be Ready For Tests and Test Anxiety** <span id="9"></span> 
*This unit will present you with strategies you can use to study for
tests, reduce or eliminate stress related to test-taking – commonly
called* test anxiety *– and increase your skills in taking tests.  
    
 The weeks and days before a test are a great time to remind yourself of
an important point: being a college student is voluntary! Put another
way, you are in college because it will help you achieve the goals you
set out at the beginning of this course. If you approach tests as an
opportunity to see how well you are doing, rather than as a punishment
or trial, you will find it easier for you to have a positive attitude
about the process. Nearly every student has experienced test anxiety at
some point, so if it happens to you, do not see it as a sign of
failure. Instead, learn the strategies presented in this unit so that
when test anxiety appears, you will have the emotional tools to manage
it.   
    
 One of the most effective strategies for avoiding excessive anxiety
during an exam is being well-prepared for the exam itself. Feeling
confident about the material comes from studying effectively and often,
and from feeling healthy and well-rested on the exam day. This unit also
covers strategies for actually taking a test, including understanding
the different question types, which questions to answer first, and other
useful tips.*

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Developing a Test-taking Plan
    and Putting It to Work”**
    Link: “Try College 101 Discussion Board” (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: One of the most important strategies for ensuring
    your college success is to develop a plan for how you will prepare
    for quizzes, tests, and exams. If you do not already have a basic
    plan, now is the time to create one. Pull out your planner or
    calendar, your course syllabus, and your course notes and other
    materials. Note all your upcoming quizzes, tests, and exams in your
    planner.  
        
     Also be sure to:  
        
     1. **Schedule time on your calendar for reviewing your course
    notes.** Divide the notes into manageable chunks and schedule time
    every day between now and the next upcoming exam to review these
    notes.  
        
     2. **Attend extra study sessions**. Make sure all your group study
    sessions, recitations, review sessions, and tutoring appointments
    are on your calendar. Don’t wait too long to try to find a tutor if
    you need one. The closer to the exam you are, the harder it will be
    to find someone who has time to help you.  
        
     3. **Plan as if you have a critically important meeting the night
    before the exam**. How can you have all your studying completed well
    beforehand?  
        
     4. **Eat, sleep, and exercise**. Don’t forget to eat properly,
    exercise, and get a good night’s sleep before the exam. Make sure
    you have a good breakfast and/or snack before the test.  
        
     5. **Relax during the exam***.* What are three things you can do
    while taking the exam to help you relax and to calm your nerves?
    Share your answers on the “Try College 101 Discussion Board.”  
        
     6. **Review test-taking tips**. Make note of effective test-taking
    strategies based on your readings in your *College Success*
    textbook. Share strategies that work for you on the “Try College 101
    Discussion Board.”  
        
     *7.* **It’s not over yet***. *Once you have completed your exam,
    read through it one last time to make sure you have not missed any
    questions before you turn it in.  
        
     When the graded exam is returned to you, be sure to review it.
    Focus on any parts of the exam in which you performed poorly, and
    use the test as a resource to prepare yourself for future exams.
    Receiving your first test grade is a good time to schedule an
    appointment with your instructor to discuss anything you do not
    understand.  
        
     *Wash, Rinse, and Repeat*  
        
     Effective test-taking is an important part of learning and is a
    skill that you will continue to develop over time. As you continue
    to improve the studying and test-taking skills that you have learned
    in this course, you will find that they will continue to pay
    dividends throughout your college career.

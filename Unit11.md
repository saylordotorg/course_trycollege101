**Unit 11: Managing Your Health and Stress** <span id="11"></span> 
*You may be aware that poor health can be a major cause of stress, but
did you know that prolonged stress can also cause bad health? Especially
if being a college student coincides with your first experience living
away from your parents, or if you are balancing school with work or your
own family life, college can present new and stressful academic, social,
and financial challenges. Managing your responsibilities well includes
managing the stress they may cause you, and this unit provides you with
proven strategies for stress management that can help.  
    
 For some people, one of the biggest challenges about stress is
recognizing the symptoms of stress before they are out of control.
Others struggle with identifying the causes of their stress. This unit
will present you with strategies to help you realize when you are
feeling stress and pinpoint the cause of that stress. It will also give
you techniques for managing and reducing stress, both in the short- and
the long-term.*

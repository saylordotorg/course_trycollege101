**Unit 1: Building and Working Towards Educational Goals** <span
id="1"></span> 
*The first unit of this course will help you clarify your individual
educational goals and formulate plans to work toward those goals. You
will define your own values as they relate to your plans for college,
and then you will create a set of specific goals that match your values.
Creating both general and specific educational goals and plans will help
you understand your academic pathway and identify direct ways to achieve
your educational goals. In short, you will have a chance to consider why
you are in college (or why you should consider enrolling in college),
what you want to get out of the college experience, and how you can
design a plan that helps you get there.  
    
 Don’t worry too much about whether the goals you set now could change
later in your college experience. At this point in your education, the
main point is to set out some thoughtful goals and start working towards
them, rather than wandering through your college experience without any
goals at all – or, worse yet, working towards goals that somebody else
has set for you.*

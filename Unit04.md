**Unit 4: Reading to Learn** <span id="4"></span> 
*At first glance, you may think that the topic of this unit – reading –
is unnecessary. You may think you already know everything there is to
know about reading. After all, if you have successfully completed the
previous units of this course, you are doing it quite well right now!
However, before you skip to the next unit, consider how often you will
be asked to read something in college. The truth is, if you approach
every reading assignment you receive in college by reading one word
after another, you will probably never finish in time.  
    
 The amount of reading material a college student is responsible for
requires types of reading skills that are different from what you likely
have been taught in elementary, middle, and high school. This unit will
explain how you can learn more in less time during your reading sessions
by scanning the body of a text and taking notes before you read,
identifying the most important passages to read closely, and then
reviewing the important material afterwards.  
    
 Reading comprehension is actually a skill that you can improve upon for
a lifetime. As you read this unit, keep in mind that the goal of
effective learning is not to read the text as quickly as possible, but
rather to read it as effectively as possible. If, in the past, you have
not been able to remember the main points of a text after reading it,
you can use the skills presented in this unit to ensure that the time
you spend reading future assignments is used in a valuable way.*

    enhance your ability to learn through reading. These self-assessment
    tools, and the brief section that follows, titled “Reading To
    Learn,” will help you measure where you are now and identify ways in
    which you can improve your own reading skills.

     Instructions: Read the chapter introduction and Section 5.1. This
    section will help you understand the ways in which reading is going
    to be different in college. In order to accomplish the maximum
    amount of learning while reading, you must take a different approach
    to a text than you did in high school or when you have read for
    pleasure in the past.  
        
     Reading this section should take you approximately 15 minutes to

    presents the four steps of *active reading*, an approach to reading
    a text that will allow you to absorb more information from a text in
    a shorter amount of time. This is a valuable skill you should work
    to acquire because you will be responsible for a great deal of
    reading as a college student! Make sure to complete the checkpoint
    exercises at the end of the reading.    
     Please note that this reading also provides information you need to
    know for sub-subunits 4.3.1-4.3.3 below.

**4.5 Building Your Vocabulary** <span id="4.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: *College Success*: “Chapter 5, Section 5.4: Building Your
    Vocabulary”**
    Link: *College Success*: [“Chapter 5, Section 5.4: Building Your
    Vocabulary”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/textbooks/College%20Success.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this section. Learning new vocabulary is not all
    about flashcards and memorization. When you read effectively, you
    absorb the meanings of many words quickly. However, one of the main
    objectives of many college-level texts, especially in introductory
    courses, is to provide you with new vocabulary that is specific to
    the subject matter you are studying. Therefore, you should have a
    strategy for how to learn and incorporate new words into your
    writing and verbal communication. Additionally, if one of your
    reasons for achieving a college education is to advance your career
    or socioeconomic status, you will want to pay particular attention
    to eliminating what this text refers to as “lazy speech,” which many
    people consider to be an indicator of lack of education. Make sure
    to complete the activities and checkpoint exercises within the text.
       
     Please note that this reading provides the information you need to
    know for subunits 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 below.   
        
     Reading this section and completing the exercises should take
    approximately 45 minutes.

**4.5.1 Lazy Speech** <span id="4.5.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath Subunit 4.5
above. The activity within the reading will help you become more aware
of how you may overuse some common words. For an even more accurate
measurement of any “lazy speech” you may use, consider recording a
conversation with a friend (with their permission, of course) and
listening to yourself, noting any verbal expressions you may want to
eliminate.*

**4.5.2 Building Better Vocabulary Habits through Reading** <span
id="4.5.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned beneath Subunit 4.5
above. Review the reading’s bulleted tips that present strategies for
acquiring new words while reading. In your notebook, make a list of the
specific types of new words you may be interested in acquiring through
your undergraduate reading. Spend approximately 15 minutes brainstorming
and describing the kinds of vocabulary you would like to gain.*

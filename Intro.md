This course is designed to equip you with the basic academic,
professional, and personal skills you will need to be successful in
college. You are probably already familiar with some of the skills and
topics that will be covered here; other concepts may be brand-new to
you. For example, perhaps you have already learned some effective
test-taking strategies that work well for you, but you have never heard
of the concept of *learning styles*. Or, you may be familiar with your
learning style, but you want to improve your listening skills and learn
how to adapt your learning style to a new academic environment. Each
student will have a different skill set when he or she starts this
course. The point of this course is to give you—a new college student or
a person considering a college education—a purposeful, thorough overview
of the many tools and skills needed for undergraduate success, as well
as to help you understand how you can improve each of these skills over
time. Keep in mind that the terms *skills*, *tools*, and *resources* can
refer to academic, social, psychological, and emotional skills and
techniques as well as physical objects such as books and supplies. You
may be tempted to consider some of the broad learning outcomes that are
outlined in this course as unimportant for your immediate success in
college. For example, you may wonder whether it is really worth your
time to think about your long-term career goals or your exercise habits
at the very beginning of your college experience. However, having a
sense of purpose that motivates you and a lifestyle that supports your
ability to focus on your academic goals are the basic building blocks of
success in college and beyond. The first unit of this course will help
you determine your goals for your college education. In other words, you
will have the opportunity to thoughtfully answer the question, why am I
pursuing an undergraduate degree? Knowing the answer to this question
will help you stay motivated when you encounter challenges during your
college experience. In units 2 and 3 of this course, you will learn how
to manage your personal space and time in order to maximize your ability
to learn, and in units 4 through 8 of this course, you will explore the
learning process itself and the different skills and tools you can use
to improve your academic performance. Unit 9 focuses on tests and
test-taking, a subject that can cause great anxiety for many students,
and units 10 and 11 provide you with general strategies for effectively
communicating with college instructors as well as managing stress,
anxiety, and other factors that affect your academic goals and overall
health during college. Being a college student can present unique and
new challenges to your health, and staying healthy, both physically and
mentally, are crucial components of your success. Unit 12 of this course
addresses the importance of your social life to your college success,
and Unit 13, the final unit of this course, equips you with some tools
to help prepare you for a career after college. By the end of this
course, you will have gained a comprehensive overview of the skills,
tools, and resources you will need for a successful, healthy, and happy
college experience. You will understand how to apply the concepts
discussed in this course to your individual academic and personal goals,
and to practice the skills you have learned by testing them in specific
college courses that you plan to take or are already taking. Finally,
you will possess a strong starting point for applying your newfound
skills to your job search and your career beyond college.

### Course Information

Welcome to TRY COLLEGE 101.  Below, please find general information on
this course and its requirements.  Please keep in mind that this course
is designed to support your ability to succeed in other college courses.
You will benefit from this course by taking it before *or* during your
college studies.

**Course Designer:** Erika Cole Gillette

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   [*College
    Success*](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/College%20Success.pdf)
-   The Purdue University [Online Writing
    Lab](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/1/) (OWL)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Most units will require you to complete checkpoint exercises that
review the textbook information as well as self-reflective short answer
questions that ask you to apply the information.  In addition to these,
you will also need to complete the Final Exam.

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
have a strong command of all the material covered in the course.  The
most efficient and effective way for you to learn this material is to
simply work through all the units and complete all the activities as the
instructor and course designer have presented them.

In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam, which is administered electronically through the
Saylor.org Moodle system.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it
again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you approximately **83.25
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you should expect to spend on each subunit.  These
are only approximate times meant to help you plan your time accordingly,
and could vary considerably for you.  Please particularly note that the
time commitment for each unit varies significantly; for example, Unit 2
should take you less than 2.5 hours, while Unit 5 will likely take you
11 hours.  It is a good idea to use the time estimates to help you plan
in advance when you will find time to complete each unit.  It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 4.75 hours.
 Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 1.5 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.3
(a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions**: The material in this course is designed to be
applied generally across all the other courses you will take during your
college experience.  As you complete each unit, try to apply that unit’s
main ideas to other work you are doing as soon as possible.
